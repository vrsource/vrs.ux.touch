Overview
========

This project contains a set of extensions for Sench Touch 2.x.  They are licensed under an MIT Open Source license.


Extensions
==========

 * Menu Panel

Class and helpers for creating menu of items that can be used in forms or menus as selectable items with decorations.

 * OpenLayers

Map component for OpenLayers.  Includes custom popup window that allows display of sencha touch panels on the map

 * App Controller Framework

A framework we put together for ST1 to allow management of hub-and-spoke model navigation stacks with dynamically created PanelControllers.  (view controllers)  Now extended to ST2 to add sugar similar to the ST2 controllers and views.  All the fun but less of the pain.

 * Utility Code

Common utility code for widgets, bug fixes, and other random things of use for multiple projects.


Future Work
===========

  * Map Helpers
    * Helper to adding an ST panel as a custom control on top of the map
     
 
Acknowledgements 
================
Many of the ideas in these extensions are based upon posts and ideas found on the sencha touch forums and other development communites around the web.  We make no claim that anything here is unique, we are simply building upon the ideas of others and trying to do our part to release it back to the community.  Where possibly, the poster of the original concepts have been referenced.  If something was missed, please let us know so we can correct it.  Without the wonderful user community of sencha touch, none of this work would be possible.
