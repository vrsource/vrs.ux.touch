Acknowledgements 
================
Many of the ideas in these extensions are based upon posts and ideas found on the sencha touch forums and other development communites around the web.  We make no claim that anything here is unique, we are simply building upon the ideas of others and trying to do our part to release it back to the community.  Where possibly, the poster of the original concepts have been referenced.  If something was missed, please let us know so we can correct it.  Without the wonderful user community of sencha touch, none of this work would be possible.
